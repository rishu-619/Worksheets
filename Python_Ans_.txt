Q11 to Q13 are subjective questions, answer them briefly

11. Differentiate between a list, tuple, set and dictionary.

Ans=List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
    Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
    Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
    Dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. No duplicate members.

12. Are strings mutable in python? Suppose you have a string “I+Love+Python”, write a small code to replace ‘+’ with space in python

Ans= In python, the string data types are immutable. Which means a string value cannot be updated.
a = "I+LOVE+PYTHON"

for i in a:
  if i == '+':
    i = " "
  print(i)

13. What does the function ord() do in python? Explain with example. Also, write down the function for getting
the datatype of a variable in python.
ANS - The ord() function returns the number representing the unicode code of a specified character.
Example => x = ord("h") ==> 104 
def dtype(lst):
  print(type(lst))


14. Write a python program to solve a quadratic equation of the form 𝑎𝑥
2 + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐 = 0. Where a, b and c are to
be taken by user input. Handle the erroneous input, such as ‘a’ should not be equal to 0
ANS - import math
    print("ax2+bx+c")
    a=int(input("Enter a value"))
    b=int(input("Enter b value"))
    c=int(input("Enter c value"))

    x=(-b+math.sqrt(b*b-4*a*c))/(2*a)
    y=(-b-math.sqrt(b*b-4*a*c))/(2*a)
    print(x,",",y)



15. Write a python program to find the sum of first ‘n’ natural numbers without using any loop. Ask user to input
the value of ‘n’.
ANS - def add(n):
  print(n*(n+1)/2)

add(n = int(input(" Enter the number")))
